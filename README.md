**Experimental Network Joint Open-source Map**

Experimental Network Joint Open-source Map (ENJO-MAP) is my personal project that aims to merge all open-source geographic information into a single platform specialized for transport engineers in Hong Kong.

For transport engineers/ planners in Hong Kong, we probably face this issue at work: you have to review geographic Information on multiple platforms. GIS software for Topo map; CAD for traffic aids review and measurement; and Google map for real-time traffic condition and O-D routing. Most of the time you just want to have a quick review for a new study area but you have to wait for the draftsman or colleagues to drag out the information and then collect the pieces to the full picture. It shortens your time to plan the upcoming work for the project. The preparation time is also a critical issue if you have to reply to your client’s enquiry for an unfamiliar location immediately, especially during meeting.

ENJO-Map has already combined traffic aids, topo map, O-D route, driving time catchment, and other simple measurement tools into a single webpage. The map is currently hosted at GitHub page (https://wnkk256.github.io/ENJO_MAP/) for the demonstration of the concept. More functions are planned for future development. Your comments and suggestions are always welcome.

*ENJO (炎上) in Japanese means on fire, this map is named as ENJO-MAP because it starts from watching my managers being ENJO in project meeting that they could not get enough information on time to reply to the enquiries.

**Upcoming work would be fully automating the data transformation of the open data and the deployment process, adding more comprehensive drawing tools, and more online available sources as layers into the map.
